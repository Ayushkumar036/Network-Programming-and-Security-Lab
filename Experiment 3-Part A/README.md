# Experiment 5 - Checksum

## Steps

At sender side,

1.If m bit checksum is used, the data unit to be transmitted is divided into segments of m bits.  
2.All the m bit segments are added.  
3.The result of the sum is then complemented using 1â€™s complement arithmetic.  
4.The value so obtained is called as checksum.  

5.The data along with the checksum value is transmitted to the receiver.  

6.If m bit checksum is being used, the received data unit is divided into segments of m bits.  
7.All the m bit segments are added along with the checksum value.  
8.The value so obtained is complemented and the result is checked.
